# Product Recommendation System using Generative AI

## Description and Features

🔍 **Overview**  
We've developed a web application using **Streamlit**, a Python-based frontend UI framework, incorporating advanced AI technologies like **CrewAI** for multi-agent systems and **Langchain** to leverage the capabilities of **Gemini-1.5-pro** and **LLaMA-70B**.

🤖 **AI Integration**  
The system integrates Large Language Models, LLaMA-70B and Gemini-1.5-pro, functioning as multi-agent AI systems that autonomously retrieve and analyze information from the internet to provide optimal product recommendations. These models do not require specific dataset training, as they fetch necessary information dynamically using various tools.

⚡ **Performance**  
The application uses **Groq API** for LPU inference, significantly reducing model response time from minutes to milliseconds.

👥 **Agents**  
It features three simultaneously operating agents:
- **Product Recommendation Agent**: Suggests the best brands and varieties.
- **Image Question-Answering Model**: Analyzes images and answers queries related to objects within them.
- **Web Search Agent**: Scours the web for products, offering relevant links and approximate prices tailored to the user's country and currency.

## Future Scope

🔧 **User Profiles and Preferences**  
Incorporate user profiles that capture individual preferences, purchase history, and browsing behavior. This could refine recommendations and responses, making them more relevant to each user.

🔄 **Adaptive Learning**  
Implement mechanisms where the system learns from user interactions to improve recommendations over time. This could involve reinforcement learning or other adaptive techniques.

## Applications
